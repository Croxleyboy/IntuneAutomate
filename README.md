## 🎯 **Purpose**

IntuneAutomate allows SME managers and IT Admins take control of useful tasks quickly like renaming a Windows device to adhere to company naming standards, assigning a user to a specific Intune managed application and deploying Industry curated Intune configuration in 3 clicks. While Intune is powerful, sometimes you need fast, actionable ways to quickly make updates without extra complexity.
This solution is Microsoft-focused and runs entirely within your own tenant, leveraging your existing security posture—no and no external subscriptions required.
A ready-to-use automation toolkit built using:
 
- **SharePoint Lists**  
- **Microsoft Power Automate Flows**  
- **A Microsoft Power Application**  
- **Microsoft Intune/Entra data**
